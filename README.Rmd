The fight against COVID-19 in the United States is generally coordinated and administered at the state level with the Federal government mainly providing resources. As such, each state's response to COVID-19 has differed significantly from that of others.  

This anmation, inspired by Aatish Bhatia's version based on the [Johns Hopkins Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) at https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/.  

However, as Johns Hopkins has stopped tracking U.S. State-level data, I instead am pulling that from the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/)'s very simple and easy-to-use API, which provides a handy JSON download.

## Analysis

The main take away is that we're all in this together.  

As of March 27, only Washington State (WA) appears to have had any significant impact on the COVID-19 growth rate. 

## Code

- `track_graph.R` is the primary script. It will output the gif. 
- Put in something here about the cron job.
